## A bit about my own story

<img src="images/JSBeardLogo.svg" alt="John Strobel" height=300px width=300px>

---

5 years at Progressive as a developer

![Six Calendars](images/Six_Calendars.png)

---

On a project for two years

![Two Calendars](images/Two_Calendars.png)

---

The first year was just learning

![Notes on Technical Things](images/TechnicalNotes.png)

---

Started looking for leadership opportunities

![Pursuit Of Authority](images/PursuitOfAuthority.png)

---

But you can't have authority as a newbie

![Authority Evades Me](images/AuthorityEvades.png)

---

Leaders are defined by their followers

![Leaders Have Followers](images/LeadersHaveFollowers.png)

---

Through Observation, this became clear:

![Leadership is comprised of Authority and Influence](images/LeadershipAuthAndInf.png)

## Authority

![Authority Logo](images/AuthAsCarrotAndStick.png)

---

### Authority
"The power or right to give orders, make decisions, and enforce obedience"

-- Oxford Dictionaries via Bing

---

More simply

![Horse and Rider with Carrot and Stick](images/RiderCarrotStickHorse.png)

---

Rewards for "good" behavior

![Horse getting a carrot](images/Destinationville.png)

---

Punishments for "bad" behavior

---

Spectrum of Authority

![Authority spectrum](images/AuthoritySpectrum.png)

---

The drawback: I don't control authority

---

Leadership is more than just authority...

***

## Influence

![Cowboy](images/Rider.png)

---

### Influence
"The capacity to have an effect on the character, development, or behavior of someone or something, or the effect itself"

-- The Oxford Dictionary via Bing

---

Put more simply

![Rider Callout](images/RiderCallout.png)

---

Riders suggest destinations, but the horse chooses

![Horse And Rider Reading Map](images/RiderSuggests.png)

---

Riders and horses have good relationships (or carrots and sticks)

![Horse and Rider playing checkers](images/HorseAndRiderCheckers.png)

---

Influence can be negative

![Angry horse, oblivious rider](images/ObliviousRider.png)

---

Negative influence has effects, too!

![Horse moves to Otherton](images/Separation.png)

---

Negativity and positivity both ripple outwards

![Obligatory ripples](images/Ripples.png)

---

The spectrum of Influence

![Influence Spectrum](images/InfluenceSpectrum.png)

---

The drawback: I don't control influence

---

Well shucks

## On variable control

---

#### I made a list

![List of things I can't control](images/UncontrolList.png)

---

#### I made another list

![List of things I CAN control](images/ControlList.png)

---

# I CAN CONTROL MY OWN BEHAVIORS!

---

Why is this guy so excited about that?

## Behaviors as they Relate to Influence

---

Maniacal laughter would make you think I'm crazy	

---

People adjust their own behavior to react to yours

![Behavior Map](images/BehaviorMap.png)

---

Over time, acting like a leader grows trust and influence

---

<span>&there4;</span> Acting "Leader-y" grows my influence 

... over time

---

I looked at my project again

![Leadership Notes](images/LeaderNotes.png)

---

Leaders become so because they act so

***

## Behaviors, Influence, and Authority

---

If you demonstrate a pattern of convincing people to listen to you...

![Authority As A Gift](images/AuthorityAsAGift.png)

---

There are many paths to Authority

## Leadership Behaviors - A quick caveat

---

Please note: these worked for *me*, and I'm weird

![Self Portrait](images/Me.png)

---

Find what works for *you*
